TeamBoard testing with free model-based testing tool (fMBT)

Required software:
fMBT (https://01.org/fmbt)
Python (2.7)
Selenium (2.0)

Test model for Teamboard is located in folder Teamboard.

Tests can be run with the bash scripts named run.sh on linux machines:
    
    ./run
    
or manually using command

    fmbt <conffile>.conf
    
where <conffile> is replaced with the one located in the test model's folder.

Different test cases can be defined by changing the input weights in the .w file.
A weight of 0 means the input will never be executed and a higher number means
the input will be executed more often. Testing this way requires that you use
heurestic="weight(<file>.w)" line in the .conf file.
