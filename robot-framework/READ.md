## Robot Framework

Robot Framework is a generic test automation framework for acceptance testing and acceptance test-driven development (ATDD). 
It has easy-to-use tabular test data syntax and it utilizes the keyword-driven testing approach. 
Its testing capabilities can be extended by test libraries implemented either with Python or Java, and users can create new 
higher-level keywords from existing ones using the same syntax that is used for creating test cases.
